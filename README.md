# Apollo Tracing Developer Tools Extension

This is a chrome dev tool extension that I wrote in a couple of hours to help me visualize the GraphQL tracing data from my requests.
It probably have some bugs but I'll fix them as soon as I can.

Also, this project was quickly done while I was learning how to create an extension, so as you can see it's not very organized. That means that before adding any new feature I need to organize it and create a build structure. Please feel free to contribute if you think you can help.
